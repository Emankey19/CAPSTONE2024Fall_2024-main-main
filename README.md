# Party Treats & Cake E-Commerce Website Capstone

This is my capstone project, an e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website is designed to sell party treats, cakes, and other sweets, the website layout if very simple and user friendly, it has 6 pages to browse:

-Homepage (index1.html): A welcoming page that displays the logo, a menu in the nav bar that takes to the pages of the website, a couple of GIF cake images, a small "About Us" paragraph and the button "Shop Now" displayed in 3 spots throught the page.

-Products Page (products.html): Displays 6 available products with images, descriptions, and a "Buy Now" button for each item.

-Sign-in Page (Login.html): Displays a form for existing users to login to their accounts with a "Remember me" box.

-Registration Page (register.html): Includes a form for users to sign up, featuring required fields like username, password, and email.

- Password reset Page(password.html): a page tha has a "enter your email" box, in which the user can enter their email in case they forgot their password.

- Checkout Page (checkout.html): Displays items added to the cart in a table format with quantity and pricing and at the bottom, the chekout form for users to input their shipping and payment information.
